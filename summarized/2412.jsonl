Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it difficult to create a reliable, universal test execution method that works across different projects. This paper presents ExecutionAgent, an automated technique that prepares scripts for building an arbitrary project from source code and running its test cases. Inspired by the way a human developer would address this task, our approach is a large language model (LLM)-based agent that autonomously executes commands and interacts with the host system. The agent uses meta-prompting to gather guidelines on the latest technologies related to the given project, and it iteratively refines its process based on feedback from the previous steps. Our evaluation applies ExecutionAgent to 50 open-source projects that use 14 different programming languages and many different build and testing tools. The approach successfully executes the test suites of 33/50 projects, while matching the test results of ground truth test suite executions with a deviation of only 7.5%.

The paper's core premise is to evaluate when graph attention mechanisms (GATs) are beneficial for node classification tasks compared to simpler graph convolutional networks (GCNs) using the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM). The theoretical framework is robust, leveraging CSBM to control structure and feature noise, which allows for a systematic analysis of GAT performance under varying conditions. However, the simplification of the attention mechanism to a non-linear function without learnable parameters raises concerns about its generalizability to real-world GAT implementations, which often include multi-head attention and complex parameterizations. Additionally, the focus on perfect node classification as a metric might be overly stringent for practical applications where approximate classifications are often sufficient. The experimental setup on synthetic data aligns well with the theoretical predictions, but the real-world dataset experiments, while supportive, lack depth in exploring diverse graph structures beyond the homophilic assumptions of CSBM. An interesting point is the proposed multi-layer GAT design, which strategically combines GCN and GAT layers to optimize SNR and mitigate over-smoothing, suggesting a hybrid approach that could inspire practical GNN designs.

Deployment tests demonstrated significant memory reduction (e.g., Llama-2-7B from 12.82GB at FP16 to 3.56GB at lower bits), enabling deployment on mainstream GPUs. The experimental design is comprehensive in model and task selection, and results align with expectations of maintaining performance via adaptive quantization. However, the lack of latency or energy consumption metrics and limited exploration of quantization split ratios suggest gaps in real-world applicability assessment.", "institution": ["National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"], "source_file": "2412.18135.json", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Efficiency", "Pre-training", "Multimodal Systems"], "temperature": 0.1, "model": "grok-3", "further_thoughts": "The LSAQ approach opens intriguing avenues for further exploration, particularly in the context of real-time adaptive systems beyond static quantization. Could the Jaccard similarity metric be extended to dynamically adjust during inference based on input data characteristics, potentially integrating with online learning paradigms to refine layer importance over time? This could address potential misjudgments in static assessments seen in edge cases like Llama-2-7B at 7-bit quantization. Additionally, connecting LSAQ with federated learning could enable collaborative importance assessment across distributed edge devices, balancing privacy and performance—how would layer importance vary across diverse user data distributions? Another insight relates to energy efficiency, an underexplored aspect in the paper; integrating LSAQ with AI for Science initiatives could optimize not just memory but also power consumption on edge hardware, critical for sustainable AI deployment. Finally, comparing LSAQ’s semantic focus with methods in vision foundation models might reveal cross-modal quantization strategies, where semantic transformation metrics could guide compression in multimodal systems, potentially unifying deployment challenges across domains.", "lang": "en", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "summary_time": "2025-05-13T03:21:41.277536+00:00", "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various domains, deploying LLMs on edge devices has emerged as a new trend. Quantization techniques, which reduce the size and memory requirements of LLMs, are effective for deploying LLMs on resource-limited edge devices. However, existing one-size-fits-all quantization methods often fail to dynamically adjust the memory requirements of LLMs, limiting their applications to practical edge devices with various computation resources. To tackle this issue, we propose Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization (LSAQ), a system for adaptive quantization and dynamic deployment of LLMs based on layer importance. Specifically, LSAQ evaluates the importance of LLMs' neural layers by constructing top-k token sets from the inputs and outputs of each layer and calculating their Jaccard similarity. Based on layer importance, our system adaptively adjusts quantization strategies in real time according to the computation resource of edge devices, which applies higher quantization precision to layers with higher importance, and vice versa. {Experimental results show that LSAQ consistently outperforms the selected quantization baselines in terms of perplexity and zero-shot tasks. Additionally, it can devise appropriate quantization schemes for different usage scenarios to facilitate the deployment of LLMs.", "title": "LSAQ: Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization for Large Language Model Deployment"}
