The paper tackles a novel and practical problem in time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) by addressing training on contaminated data, which is a significant departure from the typical assumption of clean training data in unsupervised methods. The proposed TSAD-C framework, with its three modules (Decontaminator, Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling, and Anomaly Scoring), introduces innovative ideas like masking strategies combined with an S4-based conditional diffusion model to handle noise in training data. However, while the approach is promising, I have concerns about the robustness of the decontamination process—specifically, whether masking and single-step reverse diffusion can reliably distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns without prior knowledge of anomaly distribution. Additionally, the reliance on user-defined hyperparameters (e.g., masking ratio, estimated anomaly ratio) might limit generalizability across diverse datasets. The experimental results show impressive improvements, but the datasets chosen, while carefully selected, might not fully represent the spectrum of real-world contamination scenarios. I also wonder about the computational overhead of the S4-based diffusion model and graph learning in real-time applications.

Traditional unsupervised methods assume clean training data, leading to poor performance when anomalies are present during training, as they misdetect similar anomalies in testing. Additionally, existing methods struggle to capture long-range intra-variable (temporal) and inter-variable (spatial) dependencies effectively, often relying on short-term patterns or predefined graphs that fail in dynamic environments.

The diffusion process adds noise over multiple steps, while the reverse process, guided by an S4 noise estimator, reconstructs decontaminated data in a single step during training (full steps during testing). The S4 model ensures long-range intra-variable dependencies are captured, and noise error minimization focuses only on masked portions for efficiency.\n2. **Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling**: Adopting a time-then-graph approach, this module first captures long-range intra-variable dependencies using multiple S4 layers to project data into an embedding space. Then, inter-variable dependencies are modeled dynamically via graphs constructed over short time windows, using self-attention and graph isomorphism networks (GIN) with regularization for smoothness, sparsity, and connectivity.\n3. **Anomaly Scoring**: During testing, anomaly scores are computed as a weighted combination of root mean square errors (RMSE) from the Decontaminator (based on masked data reconstruction) and the dependency modeling module (based on direct input reconstruction), with a quantile-based threshold determined on an unlabeled validation set.\nThe method is end-to-end, requiring no anomaly labels or prior graph knowledge, focusing on reducing contamination impact while modeling complex dependencies.", "created": "2025-05-09", "authors": ["Thi Kieu Khanh Ho", "Narges Armanfard"], "score": 0.9427243190941123, "experiment": "The experiments were conducted on four diverse and challenging datasets (SMD, ICBEB, DODH, TUSZ) from industrial and biomedical domains, selected for their reliability over criticized benchmarks like NASA or SWaT.

First, the Decontaminator's effectiveness hinges on the assumption that normal data predominates and that masking can sufficiently reduce anomaly impact.

The recursive memory update mechanism is intriguing as it mimics a human-like process of summarizing and updating information over time. However, I am cautious about the potential for error propagation in summaries, as factual inaccuracies could compound over iterations.

Prompts are carefully designed with step-by-step instructions to ensure the LLM captures key personality traits and maintains conversational flow.

To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context.
