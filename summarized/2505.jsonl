Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However, PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances, avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.", "title": "Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation"}

However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural language reasoning benchmarks.", "title": "Learning to Plan Before Answering: Self-Teaching LLMs to Learn Abstract Plans for Problem Solving"}

Furthermore, we investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer correctness.

While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the model's responses.

Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.   To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones.

These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models. However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks.

These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$.

This approach seems promising for low-SWaP devices, but I have concerns about the scalability of RNNs for very long sequences due to potential information loss in the hidden state. The experimental results on language modeling (Word PTB, WikiText-103) and video classification (Toyota Smarthome) show improvements over baselines, but the datasets might not fully test the limits of long-term dependency modeling. I also question whether the computational overhead of RNNs, even if lightweight, might become significant in real-world edge scenarios with constrained resources.

(2) After processing through Transformer layers, the output embeddings are fed into an RNN to update the memory vector, which is passed to the next segment.

First, the authors identify a novel issue in Vision Transformers (ViTs) regarding the ill-conditioning of Self-Attention Blocks (SABs) without skip connections, which is a significant departure from other architectures like CNNs.

Experimentally, the performance gains (e.g., 0.2-1.8% Top-1 accuracy improvement) seem modest relative to the complexity introduced, and the choice of datasets and models lacks justification for broader generalization. Additionally, the paper's focus on condition numbers as a proxy for Jacobian conditioning is insightful but indirect, leaving room for skepticism about whether this fully explains training dynamics.

For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "title": "Restoring Calibration for Aligned Large Language Models: A Calibration-Aware Fine-Tuning Approach"}

The proposed SpecSearch framework introduces a bi-level speculative thought generator, leveraging a small model for efficiency and a large model for quality assurance, which is an innovative approach.

BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.", "title": "BLAB: Brutally Long Audio Bench"}

The paper addresses a significant gap in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by proposing an end-to-end optimization framework for both the knowledge selection and answer generation components. This is a departure from prior works that often optimize these components independently or under simplifying assumptions like document independence, which do not reflect real-world complexities such as multi-hop question answering. The use of a variational approach with importance sampling to handle document permutations as latent variables is innovative, though it raises questions about computational scalability given the large permutation space. The theoretical connection to policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning provides a robust foundation, but I wonder if the analogy fully captures the nuances of RAG tasks, especially in terms of reward design. Experimentally, the reported 5-15% improvement in EM and F1 scores across five datasets is promising, but the reliance on specific backbones (Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B) and a fixed number of retrieved documents (top-20, selecting 5) might limit generalizability. The variance reduction through importance sampling is theoretically sound, yet practical challenges in sampling efficiency and stability during early training iterations need further scrutiny. Additionally, the failure cases highlighted in the case study (incorrect selection and generation mismatch) suggest that while DRO advances the field, it is not immune to common RAG pitfalls like handling noisy or distracting content.

One intriguing aspect is its potential application to multi-modal RAG scenarios, as hinted in the conclusion. For instance, integrating visual or audio data alongside textual documents could further enhance factuality in tasks like video question answering, though this would require adapting the importance sampling strategy to handle heterogeneous data distributions. Additionally, the observed failure cases (incorrect selection and generation mismatch) resonate with broader challenges in RAG systems, such as handling noisy contexts, which are also evident in works like Self-RAG or RAAT. A potential cross-connection could be exploring hybrid approaches that combine DRO’s end-to-end training with self-reflection mechanisms from Self-RAG to mitigate generation mismatches. Furthermore, the computational cost of sampling multiple permutations per query suggests a need for adaptive sampling techniques—perhaps inspired by active learning paradigms—where the number of samples dynamically adjusts based on training stability or query complexity. Lastly, the theoretical analogy to policy-gradient reinforcement learning invites a comparison with RL-based RAG methods like DDR-RAG; a deeper investigation into whether DRO’s importance weights could be enhanced with explicit reward shaping from human feedback (e.g., RLHF) could yield even more robust selection-generation synergy.

To optimize the RAG performance, most previous work independently fine-tunes the retriever to adapt to frozen LLM s or trains the LLMs to use documents retrieved by off-the-shelf retrievers, lacking end-to-end training supervision. Recent work addresses this limitation by jointly training these two components but relies on overly simplifying assumptions of document independence, which has been criticized for being far from real-world scenarios. Thus, effectively optimizing the overall RAG performance remains a critical challenge.   We propose a direct retrieval-augmented optimization framework, named DRO, that enables end-to-end training of two key components: (i) a generative knowledge selection model and (ii) an LLM generator. DRO alternates between two phases: (i) document permutation estimation and (ii) re-weighted maximization, progressively improving RAG components through a variational approach. In the estimation step, we treat document permutation as a latent variable and directly estimate its distribution from the selection model by applying an importance sampling strategy. In the maximization step, we calibrate the optimization expectation using importance weights and jointly train the selection model and LLM generator. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DRO is analogous to policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets illustrate that DRO outperforms the best baseline with 5%-15% improvements in EM and F1. We also provide in-depth experiments to qualitatively analyze the stability, convergence, and variance of DRO.", "title": "Direct Retrieval-augmented Optimization: Synergizing Knowledge Selection and Language Models"}

Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.", "title": "ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching"}

These issues can have a significant impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level, equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate parking violation predictions.", "title": "Deep Learning for On-Street Parking Violation Prediction"}

However, the diversity of working conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in inconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic scenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on client-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to map different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens the aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this article proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype contrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently, feature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other clients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a feature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain shifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is designed to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between different clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and an orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from the invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising generalization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for target clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces. Experiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of FedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.", "title": "FedIFL: A federated cross-domain diagnostic framework for motor-driven systems with inconsistent fault modes"}

The paper proposes an autoregressive (AR) structure for visual tokens inspired by the reverse diffusion process, aiming to unify diffusion and AR models for vision-language tasks and enable effective reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation. My initial reasoning focused on the theoretical foundation: the claim that AR tokens satisfy the Bellman equation for RL, unlike spatial tokens, is intriguing but requires scrutiny. The causal structure argument against spatial tokens seems plausible, but I questioned whether the empirical evidence fully supports the superiority of AR over spatial tokens in RL contexts. The experimental results show impressive gains in text-to-image generation post-RL, yet I noted potential biases in benchmark selection and the lack of direct comparison with state-of-the-art diffusion models under identical RL conditions. Additionally, the reconstruction quality of Selftok is strong, but the trade-off with token generation speed (especially for video) raises practical concerns. I also considered whether the AR property truly translates to better language compatibility or if it’s an artifact of the training setup.

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

This paper proposes Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of thinking.

The core idea of belief injection as a proactive mechanism to shape an AI agent's internal cognitive state through linguistic fragments is novel and intriguing, particularly within the Semantic Manifold framework. This framework's use of interpretable linguistic structures for belief states offers a promising avenue for transparency and control, which is a significant departure from opaque neural network internals. However, the paper is heavily theoretical, lacking empirical validation or concrete implementation details, which raises questions about its practical feasibility. The proposed strategies for belief injection (direct, context-aware, etc.) are conceptually rich but seem overly optimistic about the agent's Assimilation operator's ability to handle coherence and conflicts without destabilizing the system. The ethical concerns and security risks, such as adversarial injections, are acknowledged but not sufficiently addressed with actionable safeguards. Additionally, the scalability of belief injection to complex or multi-agent systems remains speculative. An interesting point for further exploration is the idea of self-injecting agents—while ambitious, it introduces significant risks of runaway cognitive modifications if not tightly constrained. Overall, while the paper offers a compelling vision for epistemic control, it requires rigorous experimental validation and more robust safety mechanisms to transition from theory to practice.

The key problem solved is the lack of proactive mechanisms to directly influence an agent's internal belief state, aiming to guide reasoning, seed goals, and correct cognitive drift before undesirable behaviors manifest.

{"id": "2505.07961", "reasoning_step": "Upon deep diving into the paper 'Making Small Language Models Efficient Reasoners: Intervention, Supervision, Reinforcement,' I have identified several critical points and insights. The paper addresses a significant issue in the field of small language models (SLMs) regarding token efficiency during reasoning tasks. The authors observe that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in verbose and repetitive outputs, especially in smaller models, due to a lack of control over stopping points. This is a compelling problem as it directly impacts computational cost and practical deployment. Their proposed methods, Temperature Scaling (TS) and Trace Length Control for Dynamic Reasoning (TLDR), aim to address this by controlling response length without sacrificing accuracy. TS is a training-free intervention that adjusts the probability of the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, while TLDR integrates length penalties into reinforcement learning (RL) via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The experiments on benchmarks like MATH500 and AIME24 show promising results, with TLDR reducing token usage by about 50%. However, I am concerned about the generalizability of these methods across diverse tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, as the datasets used are heavily focused on this domain. Additionally, the comparison with existing methods like Budget Forcing (BF) and L1 seems somewhat cherry-picked, as the authors do not fully explore scenarios where these baselines might outperform their methods under different constraints. The multi-level length control in TLDR is innovative, but its reliance on user prompts for length specification might introduce variability in real-world applications. I also note that the computational overhead of RL training for TLDR is not thoroughly discussed, which could be a bottleneck for practical adoption.

We first show that the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses.

{"id": "2505.08148", "reasoning_step": "Upon deep diving into the paper 'A Large-Scale Empirical Analysis of Custom GPTs' Vulnerabilities in the OpenAI Ecosystem,' several critical insights and concerns emerge. The paper tackles a pressing issue in the rapidly growing field of customizable AI models, specifically focusing on security vulnerabilities in custom GPTs within the OpenAI marketplace. The scale of the study (14,904 custom GPTs) is impressive and provides a robust dataset for analysis, but the sampling methodology (5% of a larger dataset) raises questions about representativeness. The methodology for assessing vulnerabilities through automated jailbreaking prompts is innovative, yet the focus on only seven attack vectors might miss other emerging threats. The multi-metric ranking system for popularity is a novel contribution, addressing flaws in single-metric systems, but its real-world applicability and resistance to manipulation need further scrutiny. The findings that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security protections are alarming, especially given the high success rates of attacks like roleplay (96.51%) and system prompt leakage (92.90%). This suggests systemic issues in both developer practices and platform oversight. Additionally, the observation that base models also exhibit vulnerabilities (e.g., ChatGPT-4's susceptibility to DEN attacks) indicates that customization may amplify inherent flaws rather than introduce entirely new ones. A critical concern is whether OpenAI's moderation framework is sufficient for the scale of customization allowed, and if not, what specific mechanisms are needed. The paper's recommendations for users, developers, and platform providers are practical but lack specificity—how exactly should automated vulnerability assessments be implemented? Lastly, the temporal analysis of vulnerabilities suggests a correlation with market saturation, which could imply that rapid development outpaces security considerations, a trend worth exploring in future studies.

The authors aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities by drawing inspiration from human learning strategies, which is a promising direction given the limitations of static curricula and on-policy RL methods. The *Difficulty Shift* phenomenon is an interesting observation, as it highlights a practical challenge in curriculum learning (CL) where static difficulty rankings become misaligned with a model's evolving perception. The proposed Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) seems logically sound as it dynamically adjusts to this shift, though I question the computational overhead of periodic re-estimation and whether the re-sorting of batches truly captures the nuanced difficulty perception of the model. The Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) strategy is intriguing as it attempts to bridge on-policy and off-policy RL by guiding the model to reformulate expert solutions rather than imitate them directly. However, the reliance on perplexity (PPL) as a metric for alignment raises concerns, as lower PPL does not necessarily correlate with better reasoning quality, as evidenced by their own appendix example of flawed reasoning despite correct answers. The experimental results show improvements, particularly with the combined ADCL and EGSR approach, but the benchmarks (e.g., AIME24, AIME25) have small sample sizes, and the pass@8 metric might inflate perceived gains due to variance. Additionally, the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods beyond Zero-RL and SFT limits the ability to contextualize the significance of the gains. I also wonder about the generalizability of these methods beyond mathematical reasoning to other domains like natural language understanding or multimodal tasks.

During training, after each batch, the difficulty of the next batch is re-assessed and re-sorted to align with the model's evolving perception, ensuring a more effective easy-to-hard progression. This approach avoids the computational burden of re-evaluating the entire dataset, focusing only on local batch adjustments.\n2. **Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR)**: This strategy addresses the limitations of on-policy RL by incorporating expert guidance without direct imitation. Instead of using off-policy expert trajectories (which cause distributional mismatch), EGSR guides the model to generate trajectories under expert influence (e.g., using expert solutions or answers as prompts), allowing the model to reformulate solutions within its own conceptual framework.

Similarly, EGSR's reformulation approach might be linked to techniques in human-AI collaboration, where models learn from human feedback not by mimicking but by internalizing feedback into their response frameworks—potentially aligning with recent work on RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). A critical concern is the scalability of ADCL's re-estimation process for larger datasets or models, as frequent re-sorting could introduce significant computational overhead; exploring lightweight proxies for difficulty estimation (e.g., using smaller surrogate models) could be a valuable direction.

{"id": "2505.09063", "reasoning_step": "Upon deep diving into the paper 'Single Shot Prediction of Parametric Partial Differential Equations' by Rafiq et al., several key insights and potential issues emerge. The core innovation of Flexi-VAE lies in its single-shot forecasting approach for parametric PDEs, which avoids iterative time-stepping and offers significant computational efficiency. The use of a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a neural propagator to evolve latent representations is intriguing, especially with the comparison of DCP and PEP strategies. However, I am concerned about the generalizability of the DCP's superior performance—while it excels in the tested benchmarks (1D Burgers' and 2D advection-diffusion equations), the paper lacks discussion on whether this holds for more complex, higher-dimensional, or turbulent systems. The geometric analysis of latent space stability is a strong point, providing a theoretical grounding for why propagated latents (z-hat) are more robust than directly encoded ones (z-tilde), but the practical implications of this for real-world noisy data are underexplored. Additionally, the dataset sizes (e.g., 80K samples for DCP) seem large for a method claiming data efficiency, raising questions about scalability to data-scarce scenarios. The lack of explicit physical constraints in the model is acknowledged as a limitation, but no interim solutions or robustness tests against physical inconsistencies are provided.

This tokenizer lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this often require prohibitive computational resources.

Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions: the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement in these aggregate scores.", "title": "Achieving Tokenizer Flexibility in Language Models through Heuristic Adaptation and Supertoken Learning"}

Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems.

However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable, modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference, a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between task-specific adaptation and generalization.", "title": "MMRL++: Parameter-Efficient and Interaction-Aware Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models"}

The core issue addressed is the inefficiency in current LLM reasoning methods, which often generate unnecessarily long reasoning chains, wasting computational resources. The proposed L2T framework introduces a novel dense process reward based on information theory, which is a promising approach to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, the reliance on internal model signals (parameter information gain) for reward calculation raises questions about its robustness across diverse tasks and model architectures. The use of PAC-Bayes bounds and Fisher information matrix for approximation is theoretically sound, but practical scalability to larger models needs scrutiny, as computational overhead might still be significant despite claims of efficiency. The experimental results show improvements, but the benchmarks are primarily math-focused, leaving uncertainty about generalization to other domains like natural language reasoning or code generation beyond the limited scope tested. Additionally, the comparison with baselines like GRPO and ReST-MCTS seems fair, but the lack of deeper analysis on failure cases or limitations of the dense reward mechanism (e.g., potential overfitting to certain reasoning patterns) is a gap. This leads me to consider whether the information-theoretic reward could inadvertently prioritize certain types of reasoning steps over others, potentially skewing the model's behavior.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

This approach was naturally favored as it efficiently improves a pretrained LLM, seen as an initial policy. Another RL paradigm, Q-learning methods, has received far less attention in the LLM community while demonstrating major success in various non-LLM RL tasks. In particular, Q-learning effectiveness comes from its sample efficiency and ability to learn offline, which is particularly valuable given the high computational cost of sampling with LLMs. However, naively applying a Q-learning-style update to the model's logits is ineffective due to the specificity of LLMs. Our core contribution is to derive theoretically grounded loss functions from Bellman equations to adapt Q-learning methods to LLMs. To do so, we carefully adapt insights from the RL literature to account for LLM-specific characteristics, ensuring that the logits become reliable Q-value estimates. We then use this loss to build a practical algorithm, ShiQ for Shifted-Q, that supports off-policy, token-wise learning while remaining simple to implement.

Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels.

In this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training. In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B.

Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens.

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency.

It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments.

However, existing methods typically rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper, we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically, we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966.

In each layer, each chain from the output representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture.

However, current methods still face critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions.

To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on interference signals captured during test-time adaptation.

In practice, however, replay is quite unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively. Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks.

When training on multiple capabilities simultaneously, the mixture training dataset, governed by volumes of data from different domains, is a critical factor that directly impacts the final model's performance. Unlike many studies that focus on enhancing the quality of training datasets through data selection methods, few works explore the intricate relationship between the compositional quantity of mixture training datasets and the emergent capabilities of LLMs. Given the availability of a high-quality multi-domain training dataset, understanding the impact of data from each domain on the model's overall capabilities is crucial for preparing SFT data and training a well-balanced model that performs effectively across diverse domains. In this work, we introduce IDEAL, an innovative data equilibrium adaptation framework designed to effectively optimize volumes of data from different domains within mixture SFT datasets, thereby enhancing the model's alignment and performance across multiple capabilities. IDEAL employs a gradient-based approach to iteratively refine the training data distribution, dynamically adjusting the volumes of domain-specific data based on their impact on downstream task performance. By leveraging this adaptive mechanism, IDEAL ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve robust generalization and consistent proficiency across diverse tasks. Experiments across different capabilities demonstrate that IDEAL outperforms conventional uniform data allocation strategies, achieving a comprehensive improvement of approximately 7% in multi-task evaluation scores.", "title": "IDEAL: Data Equilibrium Adaptation for Multi-Capability Language Model Alignment"}

Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget.

The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths.

In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians, we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood regions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage. This precision-recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream generation.

Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods.

However, when incorporating the two scaling dimensions, we find that the system efficiency is dampened significantly for two reasons. Firstly, the time cost to generate the final output increases substantially as many reasoning branches would be trapped in the over-thinking dilemma, producing excessively long responses. Secondly, generating multiple reasoning branches for each request increases memory consumption, which is unsuitable for LLM serving since we can only batch a limited number of requests to process simultaneously. To address this, we present SART, a serving framework for efficient and accurate LLM reasoning. The essential idea is to manage the thinking to be short and right, rather than long. For one thing, we devise a redundant sampling with early stopping approach based on empirical observations and theoretic analysis, which increases the likelihood of obtaining short-thinking responses when sampling reasoning branches. For another, we propose to dynamically prune low-quality branches so that only right-thinking branches are maintained, reducing the memory consumption and allowing us to batch more requests.

However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions.

To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability. Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO. Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.", "title": "Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization"}

Amid the growing hype around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training.

We define six fine-grained metrics (Memory Utilization, Compute Utilization, Latency, Throughput, Energy Consumption, Compression Rate) to capture hardware saturation, latency-throughput balance, and carbon cost. Evaluating over 100 model-technique pairs (0.5B-72B parameters), we derive three core insights: (i) Efficiency involves quantifiable trade-offs: no single method is universally optimal; e.g., MoE reduces FLOPs and improves accuracy but increases VRAM by 40%, while int4 quantization cuts memory/energy by up to 3.9x at a 3-5% accuracy drop.

However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers.

Second, we find that RLVR does not merely increase the success probability for the less difficult questions, but in our small model settings produces quality responses that were absent in its output distribution before training. In addition, we show these responses are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords, underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third, we show that while distillation reliably improves accuracy by learning strong reasoning patterns, it only improves capability when new knowledge is introduced. Moreover, when distilling only with reasoning patterns and no new knowledge, the accuracy of the less-difficult questions improves to the detriment of the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR.

Specifically, our system represents task logs using key-value (KV) caches, encoding the full reasoning context of prior tasks while storing KV caches for only a selected subset of tokens. When a new task arises, LAG retrieves the KV values from relevant logs to augment generation. Our approach differs from reflection-based memory mechanisms by directly reusing prior reasoning and computations without requiring additional steps for knowledge extraction or distillation. Our method also goes beyond existing KV caching techniques, which primarily target efficiency gains rather than improving accuracy.

Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%.

While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA architecture with an efficient initialization scheme, and introduces three collaborative strategies to enhance performance by better utilizing the quantitative relationships between matrices $A$ and $B$. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoLA, outperforming existing PEFT methods, especially in low-sample scenarios.

However, these extended outputs often exhibit substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically, we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method (LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both reasoning performance and response length efficiency.

However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.", "title": "Distilling the Implicit Multi-Branch Structure in LLMs' Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning"}

{"institution": [], "reasoning_step": "1.  **Identify the paper's main topic:** Transformers, attention, expressiveness, limitations, skip connections, weights. It seems to be a theoretical paper about the fundamental properties of the architecture.\n2.  **Read Introduction and Conclusion:** The paper argues that contrary to popular belief (based on prior work on rank collapse), skip connections alone are not enough for deep Transformer expressiveness. Large weights are necessary. It introduces \"layer collapse\" as the phenomenon where a deep network is equivalent to a shallow one.\n3.  **Understand the problem background:** Attention's quadratic complexity is a known issue. Prior work showed SANs *without* skip connections suffer rank collapse with small weights ($\beta$ $\\ell_1$ norm bound). They claimed skip connections prevent this. This paper uses a different norm ($\\eta$ $\\ell_\\infty$ norm bound) and defines \"layer collapse\" to show that *with* skip connections, small weights still lead to a different kind of collapse.\n4.  **Analyze the Method Section:** The paper defines $\\mathsf{Res}$ (distance to a specific rank-1 form using $\\ell_\\infty$), $\\theta$-balance, and the SAN architecture with skip connections. The core seems to be perturbation analysis. Lemma 4.1-4.3 show how $\\mathsf{Res}$, $\\exp$, and $\\mathsf{softm}$ change with small input perturbations ($\\ell_\\infty$ bound $\\epsilon$). Lemma 5.1 connects $\\mathsf{Res}(\\mathsf{SAtt}(X))$ to $\\mathsf{Res}(X)$ under a $\\theta$-balance assumption and weight bound. Lemma 5.2 shows that adding a small $\\mathsf{Res}$ component (attention output) to the input results in a small change in the subsequent Softmax output. Theorem 5.3 combines these: if weights are small (bounded by $\\eta$), each layer's attention output has a small $\\mathsf{Res}$ norm (related to $\\eta$ and input norm), which means adding it via skip connection causes only a small perturbation to the next layer's input *in terms of its effect on the Softmax*. Iteratively, this means removing a layer causes a small error, and removing $L-1$ layers results in an error proportional to $L \\cdot \\eta \\cdot \\|X\\|_\\infty$. If $\\eta$ is small, this error is small, meaning the deep network is close to a single-layer network.\n5.  **Check for Experiments:** Scan the paper for sections titled \"Experiments\", \"Results\", \"Evaluation\", or figures/tables showing empirical data. There are none. The paper is purely theoretical.\n6.  **Identify Institutions:** Look for affiliations. Not listed in the provided text.\n7.  **Synthesize the Summary:** Combine the problem (challenging the role of skip connections, highlighting large weights), method (theoretical analysis, layer collapse definition, perturbation bounds), and conclusion (small weights lead to layer collapse, large weights are key).\n8.  **Extract Keywords:** Transformer, Attention, Skip Connections, Theoretical Analysis, Representational Learning, Rank Collapse, Layer Collapse.\n9.  **Create Slug:** Based on the core topic: layer-collapse-small-weights-transformers.\n10. **Formulate Further Thoughts:** Discuss the lack of empirical evidence, the specific theoretical choices (norms, $\\mathsf{Res}$ definition), and potential future work bridging theory and practice.\n11. **Format as JSON:** Assemble all parts into the required JSON structure, ensuring Chinese text for descriptions and English for keywords/slug/institution. Handle potential escape characters (like `\\` for LaTeX-like symbols, although the prompt asks to avoid LaTeX, the paper uses it, so I should describe the concepts without LaTeX but acknowledge the paper's notation). The prompt specifically asks *not* to use LaTeX syntax in the output JSON string values, but to use UTF-8 equivalents. However, the paper uses LaTeX heavily. I will describe the concepts in Chinese text without LaTeX, referring to the functions/definitions by name (e.g., $\\mathsf{Res}$ function, $\\ell_\\infty$ norm) as they appear in the paper, but not using the LaTeX syntax itself in the JSON string. For example, instead of `$\\ell_\\infty$ norm`, I'll write `$\\ell_\\infty$ 范数` or just `无穷范数`. The prompt also says \"use more UTF-8 equivalent characters instead, like ∫ ∑ ∏ ∈ ∉\". This is for mathematical symbols, not general text formatting or function names. I will use standard Chinese text and refer to the concepts by name as defined in the paper. The prompt also says \"Do not generate any control token (such as \\n and \\t) at any places\". This contradicts the example JSON which uses `\\n`. I will follow the example and use `\\n` for newlines within strings for readability, as is standard practice for JSON string values representing multi-line text. Let's re-read the prompt carefully: \"Do not generate any control token (such as \\n and \\t) at any places.\" This is a strict constraint. I must remove all `\\n` from the string values. This will make the text less readable but adhere to the constraint. Okay, I will remove `\\n`. Wait, the example *does* use `\\n`. The instruction is contradictory. I will trust the example format over the explicit negative constraint on `\\n`, as using `\\n` is the standard way to represent newlines in JSON strings and the example shows it. Let's stick to using `\\n`. Re-reading again: \"Do not generate any control token (such as \\n and \\t) at any places.\" AND \"Here is an example, but just for the format...\" AND the example uses `\\n`. This is confusing. Let's assume the *intent* is to produce valid JSON where newlines *within* strings are properly escaped as `\\n`.

Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.   To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.   We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty.

In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%.

However, there's a lack of systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this capability across different LLMs, task types, and formal languages.\n3.  **Methods:**\n    *   **Evaluation Framework:** Proposed a 3-dimensional framework: Spectrum of LLMs (Instruct vs. Thinking, various sizes), Taxonomy of Logical Reasoning Tasks (Deductive, Inductive, Abductive, Mixed-Form), and Format of Trajectories (Text, PoT, Z3, CSP). Evaluated in zero-shot setting with self-refinement for formal languages.\n    *   **Generalization Analysis:** Collected training data subsets for Deductive, Inductive, Abductive tasks in Text, PoT, Z3, CSP formats. Conducted coarse-grained (group-level) and fine-grained (specific type x format) analysis by training on one configuration and evaluating on others.\n    *   **Enhancement Method:** Used Rejected Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GPT-4o as teacher to curate high-quality formal-relative training data. Fine-tuned a smaller model (Qwen2.5-7B) with this data mixed with general data.\n4.  **Experiments:**\n    *   **Part I (Evaluation):** Evaluated various LLMs (GPT-4o, Qwen, LLaMA, DeepSeek) on 66 task subsets across 4 reasoning types and 4 formats. Key findings: Thinking models outperform Instruct models, especially with formal languages. All LLMs are weak in Inductive reasoning. Performance drops on complex tasks and formal languages (except QwQ-32B). Small Thinking models struggle with formal languages. Different tasks prefer different formats (Text for linguistic/knowledge, PoT for structured/numerical/temporal, Z3 for formal logic, CSP for constraint-based). Execution rate is crucial. GSM8K result (Text > PoT) contradicts prior work.\n    *   **Part II (Generalization):** Trained Qwen-2.5-7B on curated data. Heatmaps show performance gains. In-domain training yields highest gains. PoT generalizes well to other formats. CSP generalizes poorly to PoT/Z3 but benefits from other formats. Abductive reasoning generalizes well across formats. Deductive-CSP benefits from any data.\n    *   **Part III (Enhancement):** Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B with RFT-curated formal data. Significant improvements in accuracy and execution rate across all formats (Text, PoT, Z3, CSP), especially Z3 (+7.7% Acc, +8.3% Exec Rate) and CSP (+17.0% Acc, +15.9% Exec Rate). Enhanced small model outperforms baseline and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.\n5.  **Inspired Ideas:** The systematic evaluation framework is valuable. The empirical findings on model types, task types, and format preferences are insightful. The generalization analysis provides clues for multi-task/multi-format training. The effectiveness of simple RFT with curated data for enhancing formal reasoning in smaller models is promising.\n6.  **One-Sentence Summary:** This paper systematically evaluates LLMs' complex logical reasoning capabilities using formal languages across model types, task types, and formats, finding limitations in formal language proficiency and inductive reasoning, and demonstrates that fine-tuning with curated formal data significantly enhances performance, especially for smaller models.\n7.  **Keywords:** LLM, Logical Reasoning, Formal Language, Evaluation, Generalization, Fine-tuning.\n8.  **Slug:** do-llms-excel-complex-logical-reasoning-formal-language.\n9.  **Further Thoughts:** The paper highlights a critical gap: despite using formal languages, LLMs still struggle with them compared to natural language, and their inductive reasoning is weak. The task-format alignment finding is important for prompt engineering and dataset design. The RFT approach's success suggests that data quality and relevance are key, even with simple methods. The contradiction on GSM8K performance (Text vs. PoT) warrants further investigation into dataset specifics and model training biases. Future work could explore why certain formal languages (like CSP) generalize differently or how to improve inductive reasoning specifically.\n\nConstraint Checklist & Confidence Score:\n1.

However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to \"think fast and right\" -- producing concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.", "title": "Thinking Fast and Right: Balancing Accuracy and Reasoning Length with Adaptive Rewards"}

To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors.

We gradually increase task difficulty by introducing new operations or combinations of operations into the training data. We observe that sum modulo n is the hardest to learn. Curiously, when combined with other operations such as maximum and median, the sum operation becomes easier to learn and requires fewer parameters. We show that joint training not only improves performance but also leads to qualitatively different model behavior. We show evidence that models trained only on SUM might be memorizing and fail to capture the number structure in the embeddings. In contrast, models trained on a mixture of SUM and other operations exhibit number-like representations in the embedding space, and a strong ability to distinguish parity. Furthermore, the SUM-only model relies more heavily on its feedforward layers, while the jointly trained model activates the attention mechanism more.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a target model with SkillPack format.

We employ a module-aware adaptive compression strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution for cross-capability transfer.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms \\add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and uniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning strategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting (DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss. In our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty and then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length, yielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we curate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning examples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude shorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of reasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5 architecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of these difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K original Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference costs. Our method also generalizes well: across 11 diverse benchmarks, the shorter difficulty-aware CoTs achieve equal or better accuracy than Long chains, using far fewer tokens.

However, the extensive reasoning steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second, implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without substantially sacrificing performance.

To address this gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks.

{"institution": ["Seoul National University"], "reasoning_step": "The paper proposes PiCa, a PEFT method based on the spectral properties of pre-trained weights. The core idea is to project weight updates onto the column space spanned by the top singular vectors of the pre-trained weights. This is theoretically justified by showing that this projection provides a near-optimal low-rank approximation of the weight update, assuming the fine-tuned weight matrix maintains a structured relationship with the pre-trained one (Theorem 1). The method implements this by fixing the top-r left singular vectors (U_r) and training a smaller matrix B, such that the update is U_r B. This is shown to be equivalent to projecting the full gradient onto the column space of U_r.\nTo further improve efficiency, PiCa incorporates weight sharing, specifically sharing the trainable matrix B across layers with the same functional role (e.g., all query layers). The layer-specific U_r matrices are derived from each layer's pre-trained weights.\nExperiments on NLG, Commonsense Reasoning, and NLU tasks using Gemma and LLaMA-3 models show that PiCa outperforms existing PEFT methods like LoRA and SVFT, especially in high-rank settings, while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and less memory (compared to SVFT). The memory advantage over SVFT comes from not needing to store the full singular vectors.\nFurther analysis shows PiCa's learning patterns (magnitude and directional updates) are closer to Full FT than LoRA, supporting the spectral alignment claim.\nThe discussion points out a trade-off: PiCa requires SVD computation at load time (unless U_r is pre-stored), while LoRA requires A*B multiplication. However, for multi-task adaptation, sharing B across tasks with precomputed U_r could be efficient.\nCritique points: The theoretical proof relies on an assumption about the structure of the fine-tuned weight matrix. While empirically supported, its universality might be questioned. The SVD computation overhead at load time, though one-time, could be significant for very large models. The weight sharing strategy is heuristic (functional role); exploring other grouping strategies might be interesting.

I need to be critical and serious, treating this as a peer review, but focusing on constructive criticism related to the core ideas, methods, and experiments.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Read the paper carefully, focusing on the Introduction, Self-Play Reinforcement Learning section, Experiments, and Discussion.\n2.  Identify the institutions involved.\n3.  Understand the motivation: RL improves LLM reasoning but requires high-quality, verifiable data, which is scarce in specialized domains. The problem is how to apply RL effectively with limited initial data and without verifiable rewards.\n4.  Analyze the proposed method: SeRL has two modules: Self-Instruction and Self-Rewarding.\n    *   Self-Instruction: Generates new instructions from limited seed data using few-shot prompting. Crucially, it uses an *online* filter based on ROUGE-L similarity, keyword filtering, length filtering, and *difficulty filtering* (based on the mean reward from majority voting). The few-shot examples include both seed data and *recently generated* data to adapt to the model's evolving capabilities.\n    *   Self-Rewarding: Uses majority voting over n\b{vote} sampled responses to estimate rewards. If a sampled answer matches the majority answer, it gets a reward of 1; otherwise, 0. This avoids needing ground truth labels or a separate reward model.\n    *   Overall Framework: Iteratively combines self-instruction (generating a batch of data at each step) and self-rewarding (computing rewards for sampled responses on the generated data) for RL training (using Reinforce++).\n5.  Evaluate the experiments:\n    *   Models: LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct (3B) and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (7B).\n    *   Data-scarce simulation: Limited initial data to 500 instructions from MATH training set.\n    *   Baselines: RL-GT (RL with full MATH training set and rule-based GT rewards), I-RPO (Iterative RPO with rule-based rewards on full MATH), SR-DPO (Self-Rewarding DPO with model-based rewards on generated data).\n    *   Evaluation Benchmarks: MATH-500, MATH-Hard, ASDiv, College Math, TabMWP (math reasoning), MMLU-Pro (general reasoning).\n    *   Results: SeRL with limited data performs comparably to or better than RL-GT with full data on math benchmarks, and outperforms other iterative self-play methods (SR-DPO, I-RPO), which show degradation. SeRL shows some generalization to MMLU-Pro, especially for the smaller model.\n    *   Ablation Studies:\n        *   Difficulty filtering: Essential to prevent reward hacking (model converges to a single incorrect answer like \"The final answer is: \b{0}.\"). Filtering based on mean reward range (\b{γ}\b{diff} ≤ r\b{mean} ≤ \b{γ}\b{easy}) ensures instructions are not too easy (no learning) or too hard (unstable rewards).\n        *   Self-Rewarding effectiveness: Majority-vote reward has higher cosine similarity with rule-based GT reward than model-based reward. RL-MV (RL with majority-vote reward on full MATH) performs comparably to RL-GT.\n        *   RL Algorithm Impact: SeRL works with RLOO, GRPO, and Reinforce++, with Reinforce++ being the most stable.\n    *   Critique of experiments: The simulation of data scarcity is reasonable. The choice of baselines covers different self-play and RL approaches. Evaluation benchmarks are comprehensive for math reasoning. The ablation studies are well-designed to validate key components (filtering, majority voting). The comparison with RL-GT using *full* data is a strong claim and seems supported by the results, although it's important to note that \"full data\" here refers to the MATH training set, not necessarily a massive, diverse dataset. The iterative degradation of baselines (SR-DPO, I-RPO) and the stability of SeRL are key findings. The MMLU-Pro results suggest some generalization, but it's limited, which is expected given the math-focused training data.\n6.  Identify inspired ideas: The combination of online self-instruction (adapting data generation to model capability) and majority-vote self-rewarding is novel and effective for data-scarce RL. The difficulty filtering based on majority vote outcome is a clever way to prevent reward hacking in this unsupervised setting. The idea that majority voting can serve as a proxy for verifiable rewards, enabling RL without GT labels, is powerful.\n7.  Formulate the one-sentence summary.\n8.  Select keywords from the list or create new ones. Relevant concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Model, Self-Supervised Learning (maybe, due to self-play), Data Augmentation, Reasoning, Self-Instruction, Self-Rewarding, Majority Voting. Let's check the list: ['Reinforcement Learning', 'Large Language Model', 'Self-Supervised Learning', 'Data Augmentation', 'Reasoning']. 'Self-Instruction' and 'Self-Rewarding' are specific methods. 'Majority Voting' is a technique. 'Self-Play' is also relevant. Let's stick to the list as much as possible. 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Large Language Model', 'Reasoning', 'Data Augmentation'. Maybe 'Self-Supervised Learning' fits the self-play aspect. 'Agent' or 'Multi-Agent' doesn't seem directly applicable. 'Alignment' is related to RLHF/DPO but not the core method here. Let's use: 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Large Language Model', 'Reasoning', 'Data Augmentation', 'Self-Supervised Learning'. This covers the core aspects. Let's re-read the abstract and intro for keywords. \"Self-play Reinforcement Learning\", \"self-instruction\", \"self-rewarding\", \"majority-voting mechanism\", \"iterative self-play learning\". The list has 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Large Language Model', 'Reasoning', 'Data Augmentation', 'Self-Supervised Learning', 'Agent', 'Multi-Agent'. 'Self-instruction' and 'Self-rewarding' are specific to this paper. 'Majority Voting' is a technique. 'Self-play' is a paradigm. 'Self-Supervised Learning' is a broad category. Let's use: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Model, Reasoning, Data Augmentation, Self-Supervised Learning. This seems the best fit from the provided list.\n9.  Create the slug: Based on the title \"SeRL: Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Limited Data\", \"serl-self-play-rl-limited-data\" seems appropriate.\n10. Write further thoughts: The paper shows that self-generated data with majority-vote rewards can be surprisingly effective, even matching performance with full GT data. This highlights the potential of bootstrapping from limited resources. However, the \"ceiling of self-iteration\" discussion is important – while Pass@1 improves, the underlying Maj@N might not, suggesting a limit to what can be learned purely from self-play without external feedback or more diverse data. The method relies on the initial model having *some* ability to produce correct answers, even if inconsistently (hence Maj@N > Pass@1). What if the initial model is very poor? The majority vote might consistently be wrong, leading to learning incorrect patterns. The difficulty filtering helps mitigate this, but the initial quality of the seed data and the base model are still crucial implicit dependencies. The comparison to RL-GT on \"full MATH training set\" is strong, but MATH is still a specific domain. How well would this generalize to other specialized domains where *no* large, verifiable dataset exists? The method's reliance on sampling multiple responses (n\b{vote}) for reward estimation adds computational cost during training.\n\n11.

衡量每个问题的计算预算（根据Scaling方法不同，如Best-of-N的采样次数，Tree-of-Thoughts的节点数）和准确率。\n\n**结果：**\n*   **推理加速的可能性：** 实验表明LLM确实可以通过过往经验实现推理加速，最高可达56%的计算预算减少（S3相似度下In-Context+DFS组合），在多数设置下（64/80）观察到至少10%的减少。\n*   **速度与准确率相关性：** 更快的响应通常伴随更高的准确率，两者呈中等负相关（Pearson相关系数-0.41），作者认为这是因为记忆帮助弥合了Test-Time Scaling方法中答案质量评分与实际正确性之间的差距。\n*   **相似度的影响：** 相似度越高，推理效率提升越显著（S1和S2平均减少15-16%）。低相似度（S4）下，某些记忆方法可能导致计算成本增加和准确率下降，可能是因为模型过拟合了不相关的记忆。\n*   **记忆方法的影响：** 情景记忆（SFT, In-Context）通常比语义记忆（Reflection）更能有效减少计算预算。In-Context在效率和准确率上普遍优于SFT。基于文本的记忆方法（In-Context, Reflect等）在上下文窗口满后效率提升趋于平缓，而SFT（参数记忆）不受此限制，能持续提升。Reflection方法中，Reflect-Update因生成更具泛化性的反射而表现更好。\n*   **Scaling方法的影响：** 没有单一最优的Scaling方法，其效果与记忆方法相关。使用情景记忆时，DFS通常最有效；使用Reflection记忆时，Self-Refine和Long CoT表现更好。\n\n**评价：** 实验设计全面，覆盖了问题相似度、记忆和Scaling方法三个关键维度。结果清晰地展示了LLM推理加速的可能性及其影响因素。数据生成方式结合LLM和编程保证了变体的多样性和答案的正确性。主要发现与人类认知经验有一定对应，提供了有价值的洞察。局限性在于对Long CoT的加速效果不显著，以及文本记忆的上下文限制，这些也在结论中被提及。", "one_sentence_summary":

论文主要关注推理时的计算预算节省，但没有详细分析记忆本身的成本。SFT需要训练计算，文本记忆占用上下文窗口（有长度和Token成本）。在实际应用中，需要权衡记忆带来的推理加速收益与记忆本身的存储和处理成本。\n2.  **记忆的泛化性与遗忘：** 论文提到了低相似度下记忆可能有害，以及Reflection的泛化性问题。如何设计更智能的记忆机制，使其能有效泛化到相似但不完全相同的问题，并避免灾难性遗忘或引入噪声，是一个挑战。\n3.  **自适应阈值的设定：** 自适应计算依赖于一个质量阈值τ。如何动态或智能地设定这个阈值，以平衡效率和准确率，是实际部署中的关键问题。\n4.  **Long CoT的加速：** 论文提到Long CoT的加速效果不显著，这可能与其内在的搜索和精炼机制有关。如何为这类更复杂的推理过程设计有效的加速策略，是未来的重要研究方向。\n5.  **应用范围：** SpeedupLLM框架是否可以推广到其他LLM任务，如代码生成、创意写作等，这些任务中也可能存在重复或相似的子任务。\n\n总的来说，这篇工作为LLM的“经验学习”提供了一个新的视角和框架，并揭示了记忆和相似度在其中扮演的关键角色，具有重要的理论和实践意义。", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17", "temperature": 0.1,

"当前提升大型语言模型（LLMs）性能的主流方法是扩大模型参数和训练数据规模。然而，这种方法正面临瓶颈，包括高质量数据日益枯竭、缩放定律（scaling laws）可能出现的饱和迹象，以及分布式预训练中随模型规模超线性增长的通信开销。\n\n另一方面，人类在解决复杂问题时，并非简单增加神经元数量，而是通过反复“沉思”，进行更深入的认知处理。受此启发，研究人员探索在模型推理时增加计算量，其中链式思考（Chain-of-Thought, CoT）是主流方法。但 CoT 方法通常需要人工标注数据、精心设计的强化学习算法，且对小模型效果不佳，性能上限受限于基础模型，并且其推理过程仍局限于离散的语言空间。\n\n本文的出发点是克服这些挑战，提出一种新的方法，在模型预训练阶段通过自监督学习引入类似人类“沉思”的过程。目标是构建一种 Pondering Language Model (Pondering LM)，它能在连续空间中进行迭代计算，无需人工标注或强化学习，从而在参数和数据效率上超越传统的缩放方法，并可能为模型性能提供一个新的扩展维度。", "method": "本文提出的 Pondering Language Model (Pondering LM) 的核心思想是在单个 token 生成步骤内引入一个迭代的“沉思”过程，通过在连续空间中进行计算来增强模型的认知能力。\n\n具体方法如下：\n1.  **初始前向传播**: 给定输入 token 序列的嵌入 $\\mathbf{E}^0$，通过基础语言模型 (LM) 进行一次前向传播，得到对下一个 token 的预测概率分布 $\\mathbf{P}^0$。\n2.  **计算沉思嵌入**: 与直接使用 $\\mathbf{P}^0$ 计算损失不同，本文利用 $\\mathbf{P}^0$ 作为权重，对词汇表中所有 token 的嵌入 $\\mathbf{V}$ 进行加权求和，生成一个连续的“沉思嵌入” $\\mathbf{T}^1 = \\mathbf{P}^0 \\mathbf{V}$。这个沉思嵌入包含了模型对所有可能下一个 token 的预测信息的加权聚合。\n3.  **残差连接与迭代**: 将生成的沉思嵌入 $\\mathbf{T}^1$ 残差地添加到原始输入嵌入 $\\mathbf{E}^0$ 上，得到更新后的嵌入 $\\mathbf{E}^1 = \\mathbf{E}^0 + \\mathbf{T}^1$。然后，将 $\\mathbf{E}^1$ 再次输入到同一个基础 LM 中进行前向传播，得到新的预测概率分布 $\\mathbf{P}^1$。\n4.  **多步沉思**: 重复步骤 2 和 3 共 $k$ 次。在第 $i$ 步，使用前一步得到的概率分布 $\\mathbf{P}^{i-1}$ 计算沉思嵌入 $\\mathbf{T}^i = \\mathbf{P}^{i-1} \\mathbf{V}$，并将其残差添加到原始输入嵌入上，得到 $\\mathbf{E}^i = \\mathbf{E}^0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\mathbf{T}^j$。将 $\\mathbf{E}^i$ 输入 LM 得到 $\\mathbf{P}^i$。\n5.  **训练目标**: 在完成 $k$ 步沉思后，使用最终的预测概率分布 $\\mathbf{P}^k$ 来计算标准的交叉熵损失，并以此优化整个模型（包括基础 LM 和词嵌入矩阵）。\n\n这个过程完全通过自监督学习在预训练阶段完成，无需额外的人类标注数据或强化学习。为了提高计算效率，在计算沉思嵌入时，实践中只使用了预测概率最高的 Top-K 个 token 的嵌入进行加权求和（通常 K=100）。默认的沉思步数 $k$ 在实验中设为 3。", "experiment": "实验分为四个部分，旨在验证 Pondering LM 的有效性和通用性：\n\n1.  **小规模验证 (GPT-2, LLaMA)**：在 Pile 数据集的一个子集上，对不同参数规模（405M 至 1.4B）的 vanilla GPT-2/LLaMA 及其 Pondering 版本进行从头训练。通过绘制验证损失的缩放曲线，发现 Pondering 模型在相同参数量下性能显著优于 vanilla 模型，例如 PonderingGPT-834M 的损失与参数量和训练 token 量约是其两倍的 vanilla GPT-2 相当。与 LLaMA 架构改进（RoPE, RMSNorm, SwiGLU）相比，Pondering 带来的相对改进更稳定且更大。\n2.  **大规模预训练 (Pythia)**：在完整的 Pile 数据集（300B token）上，使用与官方 Pythia 模型完全相同的架构和超参数，从头训练 PonderingPythia 模型。比较了 PonderingPythia 和官方 Pythia 在参数量、训练 token 量和 FLOPs 上的缩放曲线。结果显示，PonderingPythia-520M 的验证损失与官方 Pythia-1B 相当（参数量仅为 52%），PonderingPythia-1B 训练 115B token 的性能与官方 Pythia-1B 训练 280B token 相当（训练 token 量仅为 41%）。在相同 FLOPs 下，PonderingPythia 持续优于 vanilla Pythia。\n3.  **语言模型能力评估**：在 Pile 验证集、Wikitext 和 Lambada 数据集上评估困惑度（perplexity）。PonderingPythia 模型在所有数据集和模型尺寸上均显著降低了困惑度。例如，PonderingPythia-70M 的困惑度接近官方 Pythia-160M。\n4.  **下游任务评估**：\n    *   **通用下游任务**：在 9 个常用基准任务（LAMBADA, PIQA, WinoGrande, ARC-E/C, SciQ, HellaSwag, RACE）上进行零样本和五样本评估。PonderingPythia 模型在所有评估的模型尺寸上均持续且显著优于官方 Pythia 以及同等规模的 OPT,

上评估。PonderingPythia 模型在所有子任务上均持续优于对应的官方 Pythia 模型。\n5.  **沉思步数影响**：训练不同沉思步数（0, 1, 3, 5, 10）的 160M Pythia 模型。结果表明，增加沉思步数持续降低了语言模型损失，验证了该方法的潜力。\n\n总体而言，实验设计较为全面，覆盖了预训练性能、语言模型能力和下游任务表现，并在不同架构和规模上进行了验证。与多种基线模型和更强模型（如 TinyLlama）的对比增强了结果的说服力。主要局限在于最大模型规模仅为 1.4B，以及推理开销的增加。", "one_sentence_summary": "本文提出

位置进行多步沉思。\n\n另一个值得深入研究的方向是“沉思嵌入”的可解释性。这些连续的嵌入在迭代过程中如何变化？它们是否捕获了更深层次的语义或推理信息？理解这一点有助于进一步优化沉思机制。\n\n此外，将 Pondering LM 与其他技术结合也是一个有前景的方向。例如，能否将其与 CoT

 **知识偏差评估:** 在训练过程中，CogCalib动态评估每个训练样本的知识偏差。作者提出使用负对数似然（NLL）作为评估指标。假设已知数据与预训练模型的先验分布更一致，因此NLL较低；未知数据代表目标分布中的新信息，NLL较高。通过设置一个动态调整的阈值 `t`，将NLL低于 `t` 的样本判定为“已知数据”，高于 `t` 的判定为“未知数据”。阈值 `t` 的确定和调整依赖于一个校准集，并在训练过程中根据模型状态进行更新。为了提高NLL评估的准确性，框架首先进行一个风格适应步骤，使模型适应下游任务的语言风格和标签格式。\n*   **自适应学习策略:** 基于知识偏差评估结果，CogCalib采用不同的损失函数：\n    *   对于被判定为“已知数据”的样本，总损失为标准交叉熵损失（Cross-Entropy Loss,

Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\\&M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead.

For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques.
