{"id": "2403.01954", "reasoning_step": "Upon deep diving into the paper 'DECIDER: A Dual-System Rule-Controllable Decoding Framework for Language Generation,' I find the integration of First-Order Logic (FOL) with large language models (LLMs) intriguing as a method to impose logical constraints on text generation. The dual-system approach, inspired by cognitive dual-process theory, is a novel attempt to balance intuitive text generation with logical reasoning. However, I am concerned about the scalability of the logical reasoner when dealing with larger vocabularies or more complex rules, as the paper claims O(1) complexity through parallel computation, which might not hold in practice with intricate rule sets. Additionally, the reliance on ConceptNet for factual grounding raises questions about the robustness of the framework when faced with incomplete or noisy knowledge graphs. The experiments show promising results, but the improvement diminishes with more capable models like LLaMA3.1-8B, suggesting that DECIDER might be more beneficial for smaller or less pre-trained models. I also note the limitation of focusing on single-word predicates, which could hinder the framework's ability to handle phrase-level or sentence-level logic, a critical aspect for more nuanced text generation tasks. These insights will guide my critical summary and evaluation of the paper's contributions and potential drawbacks.", "problem_background": "The research addresses the challenge of controllable natural language generation, specifically focusing on lexically and semantically constrained text generation tasks. Current constrained decoding methods often prioritize target keywords greedily, leading to text that lacks naturalness and logical coherence compared to human expression. The key problem solved is the mitigation of this greedy focus by introducing high-level logical rules to guide pre-trained large language models (LLMs) during inference, ensuring generated text aligns better with human-like logic and natural expression while meeting task constraints.", "slug": "decider-dual-system-decoding", "one_sentence_summary": "DECIDER introduces a dual-system decoding framework that integrates First-Order Logic rules with large language models to guide text generation towards logical and natural outputs, outperforming baselines on CommonGen and PersonaChat tasks by balancing task completion with human-like expression.", "preference": "dislike", "updated": "2025-05-06", "top_p": 0.8, "method": "DECIDER is a dual-system decoding framework inspired by cognitive dual-process theory, integrating a pre-trained LLM (System 1) for intuitive text generation with a First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoner (System 2) for logical rule evaluation, connected by a decision function. The core idea is to shift the probability distributions of the LLM towards words that satisfy user-defined FOL rules, rather than just specific target keywords. The main steps are: 1) The LLM generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word. 2) The FOL reasoner evaluates all vocabulary words against predefined rules using a knowledge base (e.g., ConceptNet) to produce a logic vector of truth values. 3) The decision function combines these outputs by adjusting the LLM's distribution to favor rule-satisfying words, using a parameter to balance rule adherence and text fluency. This process perturbs attention distributions over previous and target words, as well as the prediction distribution for the next word, without requiring model retraining.", "created": "2025-05-04", "authors": ["Chen Xu", "Tian Lan", "Yu Ji", "Changlong Yu", "Wei Wang", "Jun Gao", "Qunxi Dong", "Kun Qian", "Piji Li", "Wei Bi", "Bin Hu"], "score": 0.9771741842213173, "experiment": "The experiments were conducted on two datasets: CommonGen for lexically constrained commonsense generation and PersonaChat for semantically constrained dialogue generation.

Metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, and custom persona consistency scores, alongside human evaluations for quality, commonsense, and coherence. Results showed DECIDER outperforming baselines in most metrics, achieving higher coverage of target concepts (97.1% on CommonGen) and better semantic consistency (Persona C2 score of 0.76 on PersonaChat). The improvement was more pronounced with less capable models like GPT-2-large compared to LLaMA3.1-8B, indicating diminishing returns with stronger pre-trained models. The experimental design was comprehensive, covering diverse tasks and model sizes, though the reliance on ConceptNet might limit generalizability if the knowledge graph is incomplete.

However, its dependency on external knowledge graphs like ConceptNet raises concerns about robustness in domains where such resources are sparse or unreliable—could this be mitigated by learning rules directly from data or integrating dynamic knowledge updates? Additionally, the diminishing performance gains with more capable models like LLaMA3.1-8B suggest that future work should explore whether DECIDER's logic-based approach can be adapted to enhance emergent abilities in larger models, perhaps by focusing on complex, multi-step reasoning tasks where even advanced LLMs struggle. Another insightful connection is to the field of AI ethics and alignment; DECIDER's rule-based control could potentially be extended to enforce safety constraints or fairness in generated text, aligning with ongoing research in trustworthy AI.

However, these methods often guide plausible continuations by greedily and explicitly selecting targets.

Inspired by cognitive dual-process theory, in this work, we propose a novel decoding framework DECIDER where the base LLMs are equipped with a First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoner to express and evaluate the rules, along with a decision function that merges the outputs of both systems to guide the generation. Unlike previous constrained decodings, DECIDER transforms the encouragement of target-specific words into all words that satisfy several high-level rules, enabling us to programmatically integrate our logic into LLMs. Experiments on CommonGen and PersonaChat demonstrate that DECIDER effectively follows given FOL rules to guide LLMs in a more human-like and logic-controlled manner.", "title": "DECIDER: A Dual-System Rule-Controllable Decoding Framework for Language Generation"}

Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens (known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors, including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors. Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much greater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize the transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between syntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding algorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions arising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers a powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new type of computation.", "title": "Agentic AI: The Era of Semantic Decoding"}
