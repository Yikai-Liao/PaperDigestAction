The paper aims to enhance long-chain visual reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through a novel data generation pipeline and a multi-agent system. The motivation is clear: current MLLMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning due to a lack of high-quality, structured datasets and effective training strategies. The proposed solution of using a reasoning agent and a summary agent to decompose the problem-solving process is intriguing, as it attempts to mimic human-like step-by-step reasoning while maintaining robustness to errors. However, I am skeptical about the scalability of the data generation pipeline, which relies heavily on other advanced models (like Qwen2 and Qwen2-VL) for assessment, potentially introducing biases or inefficiencies. Additionally, the multi-agent system, while innovative, doubles the computational overhead by training two separate models, which may not be practical for real-world deployment. The experimental results show significant improvements, but the benchmarks chosen might not fully represent the diversity of real-world visual reasoning tasks, and the improvement margins (e.g., 7.0% on LLaVA-NeXT) might be inflated by cherry-picked metrics or datasets. I also note that the iterative DPO approach, while effective, lacks a detailed discussion on convergence or overfitting risks. An interesting insight is the potential of decomposing complex tasks into specialized sub-tasks (reasoning and summarization), which could inspire broader AI system designs beyond MLLMs. A concern is whether the system’s robustness to flawed reasoning paths, as claimed, holds under more adversarial or noisy conditions not tested in the paper.

To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning.

The authors propose ASTRA, a novel defense mechanism for Vision Language Models (VLMs) against jailbreak attacks, which exploit visual inputs to induce harmful outputs. The core idea of adaptive steering to mitigate adversarial effects without compromising benign performance is intriguing, especially given the efficiency claims. However, I must critically assess whether the method truly addresses the root causes of VLM vulnerabilities or merely offers a symptomatic fix. The use of image attribution to construct steering vectors is innovative, but I question the generalizability of the selected visual tokens across diverse attack types and whether the linear surrogate model (Lasso) adequately captures complex non-linear interactions in VLM feature spaces. The experimental results show impressive reductions in toxicity and attack success rates, but the reliance on specific datasets and attack types (e.g., PGD) raises concerns about overfitting to these scenarios. Additionally, while transferability to unseen attacks is demonstrated, the performance drop in some out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios suggests limitations in robustness.
