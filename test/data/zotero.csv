ControlNet locks the production-ready large diffusion models, and reuses their deep and robust encoding layers pretrained with billions of images as a strong backbone to learn a diverse set of conditional controls. The neural architecture is connected with ""zero convolutions"" (zero-initialized convolution layers) that progressively grow the parameters from zero and ensure that no harmful noise could affect the finetuning. We test various conditioning controls, eg, edges, depth, segmentation, human pose, etc, with Stable Diffusion, using single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts. We show that the training of ControlNets is robust with small (<50k) and large (>1m) datasets. Extensive results show that ControlNet may facilitate wider applications to control image diffusion models.","2023-11-26","2025-05-25 13:09:41","2025-05-25 13:09:41","2025-05-25 13:09:41","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2302.05543 [cs]","","/Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/ISED9QYI/Zhang 等 - 2023 - Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffus.pdf; /Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/ISCEWB77/2302.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Graphics; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; Computer Science - Multimedia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2302.05543","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the predominance of closed-source models has restricted extensive research and development. To address this, we introduce the DeepSeek-Coder series, a range of open-source code models with sizes from 1.3B to 33B, trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens. These models are pre-trained on a high-quality project-level code corpus and employ a fill-in-the-blank task with a 16K window to enhance code generation and infilling. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-Coder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models across multiple benchmarks but also surpasses existing closed-source models like Codex and GPT-3.5. Furthermore, DeepSeek-Coder models are under a permissive license that allows for both research and unrestricted commercial use.","2024-01-26","2025-05-25 14:19:15","2025-05-25 14:19:15","2025-05-25 14:19:15","","","","","","","DeepSeek-Coder","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2401.14196 [cs]","","/Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/RDBQZFKK/Guo 等 - 2024 - DeepSeek-Coder When the Large Language Model Meet.pdf; /Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/S82LNDEX/2401.html","","","Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2401.14196","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detecting fibers in a degraded image poses a challenge to both current fiber detection and ellipse detection methods. This paper proposes a new semi-supervised deep learning method for large-scale elliptical fiber detection with synthetic data, which frees people from heavy data annotations and is robust to various kinds of image degradations. A domain adaptation strategy is utilized to reduce the domain distribution discrepancy between the synthetic data and the real data, and a new Region of Interest (RoI)-ellipse learning and a novel RoI ranking with the symmetry constraint are embedded in the proposed method. Experiments on real microscopic material images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in large-scale fiber detection.","2023-02-10","2025-05-25 14:21:12","2025-05-25 14:21:12","2025-05-25 14:21:12","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2302.05541 [cs]","","/Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/Z77GSYK8/Fu 等 - 2023 - Semi-supervised Large-scale Fiber Detection in Mat.pdf; /Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/XKCX3LMX/2302.html","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2302.05541","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wander radius and anisotropy profiles","Astronomy & Astrophysics","","0004-6361, 1432-0746","10.1051/0004-6361/202346124","http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05542","We recently introduced a new method for simulating collisional gravitational N-body systems with approximately linear time scaling with $N$, based on the Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) scheme, previously applied in Plasma Physics. We simulate globular clusters with a realistic number of stellar particles (at least up to several times $10^6$) on a standard workstation. We simulate clusters hosting an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), probing a broad range of BH-cluster and BH-average-star mass ratios, unrestricted by the computational constraints affecting direct N-body codes. We use either single mass models or models with a Salpeter mass function, with the IMBH initially sitting at the centre. The force exerted by and on the IMBH is evaluated with a direct scheme. We measure the evolution of the Lagrangian radii and core density and velocity dispersion over time. In addition, we study the evolution of the velocity anisotropy profiles. We find that models with an IMBH undergo core collapse at earlier times, the larger the IMBH mass the shallower, with an approximately constant central density at core collapse. The presence of an IMBH tends to lower the central velocity dispersion. These results hold independently of the mass function. For the models with Salpeter MF we observe that equipartition of kinetic energies is never achieved. Orbital anisotropy at large radii appears driven by energetic escapers on radial orbits. We measure the wander radius. Among the results we obtained, which mostly confirm or extend previously known trends that had been established over the range of parameters accessible to direct N-body simulations, we underline that the leptokurtic nature of the IMBH wander radius distribution might lead to IMBHs presenting as off-center more frequently than expected, with implications on observational IMBH detection.","2023-05","2025-05-25 14:21:25","2025-05-25 14:21:25","2025-05-25 14:21:25","A8","","","673","","A&A","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2302.05542 [astro-ph]","","/Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/MIX8NFAZ/Cintio 等 - 2023 - Dynamics of intermediate mass black holes in globu.pdf; /Users/j1feng/Zotero/storage/FW7EVBJ8/2302.html","","","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
